# Day 6 - 4-bit Comparator

## Description
This task involves designing a 4-bit comparator using Verilog. The comparator checks two 4-bit binary numbers and outputs whether one is greater than, equal to, or less than the other.

## Files Included
- `comparator_4bit.v` – Verilog code for the 4-bit comparator.
- `tb_comparator_4bit.v` – Testbench for simulating the comparator.

## Tools Used
- Yosys
- Icarus Verilog
- GTKWave

## Steps Followed
1. Wrote Verilog code for 4-bit comparator.
2. Created testbench to validate all cases.
3. Simulated using Icarus Verilog and viewed waveform in GTKWave.
